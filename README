Project 4 - cs4280

Your fourth part of the project is to traverse the tree and generate code.  The output is a text
file (so you can hand check it) containing assembly language commands, their arguments (if
any), linker-loader instructions, and initializations of data space (if any).  On the webpage
there is a link to an overview of the instructions and the linker/loader commands.
The only 2 “unusual” statements are the
assert
and the
bind
.  For the
assert
statement,
the expression is evaluated.  If expression is true, continue; if expression is false, halt.
For the
bind
statement, the new variable [before the word
to
gets the same address (and
the same type) as the variable or field reference to the right.
Note that the only way to exit a
loop
is to use one of the two
exit
statements; they exit
the innermost loop, either unconditionally or if the condition is true.
Note that the
not=
operator is the boolean test for ‘Not Equal’.  Also note that there are
only 2 conditions in the machine language:  ‘Equal 0’ and ‘LessThan 0’; this (with the rules
of algebra of comparisons) is sufficient.
I have written an emulator for the machine;  in the usual place,  there is a command
run
.
Any command line arguments are taken to be text files with assembly instructions in the
LINK-LOAD format specified.  On the same webpage as the machine instructions there is
a page with (most) of the interactive commands for the debugging of programs within this
command.
If you want more information, the
doc
subdirectory in the usual place has documents on the
machine.  Each file is in three forms:  a L
A
T
E
Xfile, which is (pretty much) readable, and a pdf
file, which is printable in the usual way.
